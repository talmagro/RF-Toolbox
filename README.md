# RF Toolbox

A Python-based RF toolbox for simulating and analyzing different stages of an RF signal chain.  
The project is structured as a collection of modular Python files, each representing a specific RF block (e.g. source, amplifier, filter, noise, etc.), allowing flexible construction and simulation of RF systems.

## Project Goals

- Model and simulate RF signal chains in a modular way
- Analyze signal behavior across multiple RF stages
- Provide reusable building blocks for RF system prototyping
- Support visualization and numerical analysis using Python scientific libraries

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- pip
- Virtual environment (recommended)

Main dependencies:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
